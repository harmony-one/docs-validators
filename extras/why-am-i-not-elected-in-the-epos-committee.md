# Why am I not elected in the EPOS committee

## EPOS medium document

[https://harmony.one/epos](https://harmony.one/epos)

## **Now let’s get into action.**

Non election in the EPOS committee are caused by two main issues :

1. Your validator profile needs to have satisfactory conditions
   1. current total stake has to be among the 320 highest stake before the change of next epoch
   2. Active flag needs to be true
   3. The numbers of block signed per epoch needs to be above 66%
2. Your node needs to be functional
   1. Fully synced
   2. Signing blocks

## **Validator profile need to satisfy the below**

### Bidding for a place in the EPOS committee

#### Verify the median stake

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
```bash
./hmy -n https://api.s0.os.hmny.io blockchain median-stake
{
  "id": "0",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 286000000000000000000
}

```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Staking Explorer" %}
go to : [https://staking.harmony.one/validators](https://staking.harmony.one/validators)

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
the CLI returned a value in wei, it can be converted online converter like [https://eth-converter.com/](https://eth-converter.com/)
{% endhint %}

#### Total delegation is above the median stake

Visit [https://staking.harmony.one/validators/](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/)&lt;youroneaccount&gt; 

Example : [https://staking.harmony.one/validators/one1u6c4wer2dkm767hmjeehnwu6tqqur62gx9vqsd](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/one1u6c4wer2dkm767hmjeehnwu6tqqur62gx9vqsd)

![Validator Total stake](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NLgZVG_11gM5bVMv-17Rwsjc8-TG7nTfXuDs6tdxtUbVFgtD0uNbx39GIDoGcUXEkJhmu9s2pDTBk88ZdrdVj_N5Lz_TVDHvivMBVOlrbwV1l2Kubs1NRTvnLMi5qXlCm79sP__k)

Your current total stake has to be among the 320 highest stake before the change of next epoch. For that, one way to make sure of it is to be near / above the median stake.

If you are not above the median stake then time to ask for more delegation or delegate yourself more ONE token following this doc on [how to delegate more ONE token](https://docs.harmony.one/validators/validator/managing-your-validator/delegating-to-a-validator)

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure your max-total-delegation is high enough and above the median stake so your added delegation works
{% endhint %}

#### **Your validator node Active flag needs to be true**

Issue the command   
./hmy -n [https://api.s0.os.hmny.io](https://api.s0.os.hmny.io) blockchain validator information &lt;ONE\_VALIDATOR\_ACCOUNT&gt; \| grep active

```text
./hmy -n https://api.s0.os.hmny.io blockchain validator information  one1u6c4wer2dkm767hmjeehnwu6tqqur62gx9vqsd | grep active
    "active": false,
```

If false, update it to active true via the command   
./hmy -n [https://api.s0.os.hmny.io](https://api.s0.os.hmny.io) staking edit-validator --validator-addr &lt;ONE\_VALIDATOR\_ACCOUNT&gt; --active true --passphrase

```text
./hmy -n https://api.s0.os.hmny.io staking edit-validator --validator-addr one1u6c4wer2dkm767hmjeehnwu6tqqur62gx9vqsd --active true --passphrase
```

**Finally check your signed blocked**

using the command  
./hmy -n [https://api.s0.os.hmny.io](https://api.s0.os.hmny.io) blockchain validator information &lt;ONE\_VALIDATOR\_ACCOUNT&gt;

```text
./hmy -n https://api.s0.os.hmny.io blockchain validator information one1u6c4wer2dkm767hmjeehnwu6tqqur62gx9vqsd
```

and search for :

```text
   "current-epoch-signing-percent": {
      "current-epoch-signed": 0,
      "current-epoch-to-sign": 75,
      "percentage": "0.000000000000000000"
    },

```

the above explain why your validator became offline as the % needs to be above 66%. To fix the above, we have to make sure the node is working correctly and below are few pointers

### Your node needs to be functional

#### Fully synced node

Compare your block height

```text
./hmy blockchain latest-header | grep blockNumber
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
If the above doesn’t work and you have an error message similar to this: _commit: v304-0e26945, error: dial tcp4 127.0.0.1:9500: connect: connection refused_   
It means the harmony node binary is not running. Please follow this documentation on [how to run the node](https://docs.harmony.one/validators/validator/first-time-setup/download-node-script).
{% endhint %}

and the network block height

```text
./hmy -n https://api.s0.os.hmny.io blockchain latest-header | grep blockNumber 
```

Make sure network height and your current height are very close or equal. Also, for non shard 0 node, you need 2 DBs to be synced, your non-shard 0 and the shard 0.

{% hint style="info" %}
the above command is for network height on shard 0, change s0 to s1, s2, .. to match yours in the api URL
{% endhint %}

When you are fully synced and your validator profile is satisfactory you should start having BINGOs in your validator log file at **epoch change**.

You can check BINGOs via this command

```text
tail -f latest/zero*.log | grep BINGO
```

And you’ll notice in your validator information that you started signing blocks

```text
   "current-epoch-signing-percent": {
      "current-epoch-signed": 5,
      "current-epoch-to-sign": 5,
      "percentage": "100.000000000000000000"
    },

```

**If you fail** to sign blocks, verify your machine/vps doesn't have CPU/memory/hard disk/internet issues. When you fail to sign more than 66% of the blocks in an epoch, you’ll be kicked out from the committee and your active flag will become false again.
