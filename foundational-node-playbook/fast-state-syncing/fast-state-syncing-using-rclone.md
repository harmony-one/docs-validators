# Using Rclone

This document introduces another centralized fast state syncing method using rclone. The document is still working-in-progress. Please use it with caution. This guide is mainly used for a newly started node to catch up with the blockchain faster. Otherwise, the blockchain syncing may take weeks.

Rclone db snapshot is sync'ed with blockchain once a day. It is more recent than the db tarball. However, there maybe a potential race condition when the rclone may fail due to our nodes were updating the db files at the same time. In this case, just re-run the rclone command to re-sync again.

## Rclone

If you don't know what is rclone, please visit the rclone website for some more info and usage.

Install rclone =&gt; [https://rclone.org/](https://rclone.org/)

## Rclone.conf

Add the following `rclone.conf` file to `~/.config/rclone` directory

```text
[mainnet]
type = s3
provider = AWS
env_auth = false
region = us-west-1
acl = public-read
server_side_encryption = AES256
storage_class = REDUCED_REDUNDANCY
```

## Rclone DB snapshot

* For example, rclone DB snapshot for shard 0.  Just replace `ShardID` with the real shard ID 0.

```text
rclone sync mainnet:pub.harmony.one/mainnet/harmony_db_<ShardID> harmony_db_<ShardID>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Nodes in shard 0 just need to sync `harmony_db_0`

Nodes in shard 1, 2, 3 need to sync both `harmony_db_0`, and `harmony_db_<shardid>`
{% endhint %}
