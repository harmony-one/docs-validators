# Cloud setup

While running a local Harmony node is possible and encouraged, most validators run their nodes on cloud service providers. This section will explain how to set up your node on common cloud providers [**AWS**](aws.md), **Vultr** and **Google Cloud.**

If you are curious to know which cloud provider is right for you, read the ****[**Choosing a cloud provider section**](../../../extras/choosing-a-cloud-provider.md) in the Extras section.

If you choose to use a cloud provider different from those listed above, you are best off to follow the **Vultr** guide step by step but be aware that some steps will be different.
