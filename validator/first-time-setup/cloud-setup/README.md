# Cloud Guides

We have written a guide for setting up a Harmony node for [Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)](aws.md), [Vultr](vultr.md), [Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\)](google-cloud.md) to make things as simple as possible!

If you are curious to know which cloud provider is right for you, read the ****[**Choosing a cloud provider section**](../../../extras/choosing-a-cloud-provider.md) in the Extras section.

If you choose to use a cloud provider different from those listed above, you are best off to follow the [Vultr](vultr.md) guide step by step but be aware that some steps will be different.
