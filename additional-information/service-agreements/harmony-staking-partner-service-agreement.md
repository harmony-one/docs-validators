# Staking Partner Service Agreement

Harmony blockchain provides open staking support, which means anyone with enough Harmony [$ONE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harmony/) token based on [EPoS](https://medium.com/harmony-one/introducing-harmonys-effective-proof-of-stake-epos-2d39b4b8d58) can create a validator node o validate the blockchain while earning block rewards. Any token holders can also delegate their tokens to any validators. Validators may earn a certain amount of commission of the block rewards earned by the stake delegated by the delegators. There are a limited number of seats as validators in each shard of the blockchain. The first stage of the open staking will have 40% of the 1000 seats open to external nodes.

Harmony Staking Partners are more than just regular validators. They provide reliable and long running validating service to Harmony blockchain. Staking partners provide the highest level of services with high availability, high efficient validating services to the blockchain. They are certified as the official staking partners of Harmony blockchain so that they can gain more attractions from other staking delegators.
